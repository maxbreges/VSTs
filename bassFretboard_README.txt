bassFretboardx86 Â© Max Brezhestovski 2024

Important:

bassFretboardx86 plugin is a VST2 plugin made for personal purposes for helping students to learn bass fingering who are still using/or are bound to use 32-bit operating systems and DAWs.
bassFretboardx86 can not be published, distributed, sublicensed, and/or sold.


Important as well:

Plugin receives MIDI data on four MIDI channels:
Channel 1 for G-string;
Channel 2 for D-string;
Channel 3 for A-string;
Channel 4 for E-string;

So please set your MIDI track or whatever what sends MIDI data to the plugin to 'Any' or 'Multi'.
MIDI files should be prepared in a special way (setting MIDI channel for each note) to display fingering properly.

Also, one may need to keep in mind the range of the notes for the strings:
G-string 43-61;
D-string 38-56;
A-string 33-51;
E-string 28-46;

There's also a button switch instead of one of the fret dots which switches between sharps and flats.
